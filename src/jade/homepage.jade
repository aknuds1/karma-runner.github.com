        The main goal for Testacular is to bring a productive testing 
        environment to developers. An environment, where they don't have 
        to set up many things and rather just write the code and get an 
        instant feedback. Because getting a quick feedback is what makes you 
        productive and creative.

              Testacular is framework agnostic. However it ships with 
              adapters for [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), 
              [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) and 
              [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), as well as 
              [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)'s scenario runner.
